# weatherApp

## Description
For this challenge it was my job to start from scratch, and build a weather dashboard. This dashboard uses the open weather map API 
to retrieve weather information about whichever city the user would like to search for. It then displays the current weather conditions
and below that, a 5-day forecast. The page also saves search history and the history can be clicked to display that information again. 
The page also uses local storage to store persistent data. The URL to the deployed page is: https://sevepalattao.github.io/weatherApp/ 

## Screenshot

Below is a screenshot of the page with a few examples searches shown.
